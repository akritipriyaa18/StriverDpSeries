IDENTIFICATION OF RECURSIVE PROBLEMS:
->Trying all possible ways
->If it's a recursive problem, it will be of two types:
  1. Count no of ways.
  2. Min/Max Output.


RULE TO WRITE RECURRENCE:-
1. Express in terms of indexs.
2. Do all possible stufs acc to problem statement.
3. Sum of all stuffs ---> Count all ways //////  Max / Min of all stuffs ----> Find min/ max
4. Base case


If overlapping subproblems ----> memoization 

RULE TO WRITE MEMOIZED CODE:
1. Initialize dp array of size + 1.
2. Store results in dp array.
3. Check if dp array stores the result we are searching for , if yes return.

To decrease space complexity ----> Tabulation

RULE TO WRITE TABULATION CODE:
1. Declare the dp array of same size.
2. Base cases
3. Form the nested loops ---> in opposite fashion of memoized code
